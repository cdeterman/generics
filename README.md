This is the `generics` package.  This package is meant simply to provide
s4 Generics for users to leverage for CRAN intended packages.  This is, 
for all purposes, a peer package to the [BiocGenerics](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocGenerics.html) 
package but allows for users to develop for the CRAN repository.
